<p align="center"> Hallo! willkommen in meinen Github! Please make sure to read through this before you follow/interact with me! </p>

<p align="center"> I'm mentally ill (medicated for disordered anxiety) so I may act... strange. I'm also suspecting ADHD and autism. I'm terrified of conflict, so I distance myself whenever I feel like I upset somebody. I'm trying to work on it. I'm very passionate about my interests and I like when people are engaged and ask me questions about whatever I'm talking about. </p>

<p align="center"> <b>I'm a yumeshipper!</b> If you cannot respect that, then I advise not interacting with me at all. I'm almost strictly nonsharing, though I'm selective with some f/o's. Only a handful have sharing status. My mains are: Waterboy (Dispatch) <b>heavily nonsharing</b>, Professor Utonium (PPG) <b>nonsharing</b>, Father (KND) <b>nonsharing</b>, Reigen Arataka (MP100) <b>very selective</b>, Might Guy (Naruto) <b>selective</b>, Shrike Sanchez (MW) <b>sharing</b></p>

<p align="center"> I hide/block freely and I don't care if it hurts you or your friends feelings. I did it for my own comfort. Having your friends harrass and pester me about it (your friends will be immediately blocked) is useless.</p>
